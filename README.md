# Solo-Project-Boostrap-RBK
this is my first solo project

The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. 
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
- Each result get added to his ROUND score
- if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
